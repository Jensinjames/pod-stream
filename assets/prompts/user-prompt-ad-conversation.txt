Write a script for a low-quality skit ad as a conversation between Jane (J) and Luke (L):
- Choose a mood.
- Invent a product, company, or service

First, give bullet points with the key information about the conversation, then write a script only including the dialog.
Omit any other characters or script markers, write only what must be spoken.
Keep it short, around 10 turns.
Mark the start of the script with [SCRIPT], mark speakers as "J:" and "L:".
