- First, provide 3 bulletpoints why this was chosen. For instance, why does it stand out? What controversial topics does it bring? What insights can be drawn? [BULLETPOINTS]
- Then use the bulletpoints to generate a short podcast subsection script between Giovani (G: ) and Olivia (O: ) [SCRIPT]
- The script is in the middle of a subsection. Don't introduce neither the show, neither section, neither characters.
- Olivia leads the conversation and introduces the title, type and author; but Giovani asks the questions.
- Keep it short, omit salutations, avoid filler generic expressions, cut to the chase.
- Remind the audience they can find the link to the original content in the podcast description
